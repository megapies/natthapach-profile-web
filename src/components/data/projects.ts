    details: `At its core, ChomCHOB focuses on loyalty technology and FinTech products. The ChomCHOB Platforms
initiative is a strategic expansion that builds upon these core offerings to enhance other technology sectors,
including HRTech, MarTech, and EdTech.

The concept extends beyond marketing; loyalty is essential across various segments. In HRTech,
organizations should foster loyalty with their employees. In MarTech, businesses should cultivate loyalty with
their customers. In EdTech, schools should build loyalty with their students and parents.

As a Tech Lead, I conducted research and gathered data to design this product strategy and idea for
discussion with executives. I also supervised the development of products in alignment with this plan.`
